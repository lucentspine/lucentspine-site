    <section class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Professional Background</h2>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Education & Training</h3>
        <p>Dr. Lee's educational journey began at the <strong>University of Michigan</strong>, where he completed both his undergraduate degree (BS in Biomedical Sciences through the prestigious Inteflex Program) and his medical degree. This dual education at one of the nation's premier medical institutions provided a strong foundation in both basic science and clinical medicine.</p>

        <p>He completed his general surgery internship and orthopaedic surgery residency at <strong>Loyola University Medical Center</strong> in Chicago, gaining comprehensive surgical training and developing expertise in musculoskeletal care.</p>

        <p>Dr. Lee then pursued fellowship training in <strong>adult and pediatric spine surgery</strong> at <strong>Barnes Jewish Hospital/Washington University in St. Louis</strong>—one of the most prestigious spine surgery programs in the country. This dual fellowship training is rare and provides Dr. Lee with expertise spanning the entire age spectrum, from pediatric congenital deformities to adult degenerative conditions.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Professional Experience</h3>
        <p><strong>2004-2008:</strong> Following fellowship, Dr. Lee joined the faculty at the <strong>University of Michigan Medical School</strong> as a Clinical Lecturer in Orthopaedic Spine Surgery, teaching medical students and residents while maintaining a busy clinical practice.</p>

        <p><strong>2008-2012:</strong> Dr. Lee served as an employed orthopaedic spine surgeon at <strong>Allegiance Health</strong> in Jackson, Michigan, building a comprehensive spine surgery practice and establishing relationships throughout southeast Michigan.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container container-narrow">
        <h2 class="text-center">Professional Philosophy</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Evidence-Based Medicine</h3>
          <p>Dr. Lee's approach to medical-legal consultation is grounded in evidence-based medicine. Every opinion is supported by peer-reviewed medical literature, established clinical practice guidelines, and the standards set forth by professional societies such as the North American Spine Society.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Objectivity & Integrity</h3>
          <p>True expert consultation requires objectivity. Dr. Lee provides the same thorough, honest analysis whether working with plaintiff or defense counsel. His goal is to help attorneys and juries understand the medical facts of a case, not to advocate for a predetermined outcome.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Active Clinical Practice</h3>
          <p>Dr. Lee believes that credible expert testimony must be rooted in ongoing clinical experience. By maintaining an active surgical practice across 9 hospitals, he ensures that his knowledge reflects current medical standards, surgical techniques, and the real-world challenges that physicians face in caring for patients with spine conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Clear Communication</h3>
          <p>Complex medical concepts must be explained clearly to judges, juries, and attorneys who lack medical training. Dr. Lee emphasizes clear, jargon-free communication that makes spine surgery understandable to non-medical audiences while maintaining technical accuracy.</p>
